# TENZU TRADEMARKS POLICY

## The Tenzu Trademark

The brand and word "Tenzu" has trade mark protection in many countries around
the world. Various Tenzu™ trade marks are owned by BIRU Scop ARL. The law obligates
trade mark owners to police their trade marks and prevent the use of
confusingly similar names by third parties.

We need to be clear about use of the word "Tenzu" and how we restrict its use
when promoting commercial Tenzu™ branded services. The proper use of
trade marks reliably assures consumers about the quality of the associated
products or services and where they have been derived from. Because Tenzu
is made available under the open source ‘GNU Affero General Public License'
that permits you to modify the copyrighted software, the distribution of such
modified software in combination with Tenzu trade marks can potentially
mislead others in the community. To be clear, the GNU AGPL does not include an
implied right or licence to use Tenzu's trade marks.

We do all this to protect the very business model that allows us to continue
developing Tenzu for you.

You can **freely use** what is included in this git repository under its
opensource license, either for a non-commercial purposes, or for commercial purposes
as long as you replace trademarked content (including without limitation the
Tenzu name and logo).

## Allowed uses of "Tenzu"

The following uses don't require any permission at all:

* Referring to the software or the Tenzu project as the "Tenzu™ software"
  or the "Tenzu™ project"
* Describing your own implementation of the Tenzu™ software platform
  (including within corporate settings).
* Describing a Tenzu-based community hub.
* Describing certain software you've made that integrates with Tenzu™
  branded software (e.g. a Tenzu™ integration feature on another system).

## Restricted uses of "Tenzu"

The following uses are generally prohibited without explicit and direct
permission being granted to you by BIRU Scop ARL. We do this to protect the
Tenzu™ project from software and sites which could confuse people. If in
doubt, reach out for clarification at <ask@tenzu.net>

* You can't use the word "Tenzu" or any Tenzu logos for commercial purposes
  without prior written permission from BIRU Scop ARL.
* You can't use "Tenzu" in the name of your software (including Mobile apps).
* You can't use "Tenzu" in your company name.
* You can't use "Tenzu" in your domain name.
* You can't use "Tenzu" in advertising-related keywords (such as Adsense).
* You can't use "Tenzu" to describe services around Tenzu
  (such as hosting, training, support, consulting, course creation services,
  theme development, customisation, installation, integration, analytics
  and certification) that cause consumers to be confused that you are
  associated with BIRU Scop ARL if you are not.
  This applies even if you do not charge for the services.
  Note that usually only Tenzu Partners have this permission.

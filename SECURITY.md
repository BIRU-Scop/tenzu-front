## Security Issues

***Any security issues should be submitted through one of the following methods:***
- https://github.com/BIRU-Scop/tenzu-front/security/advisories
- Through our email: ask@tenzu.net

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask
yourself these two questions:

1. Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to? 
2. Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably
dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both
questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure,
just email us at <ask@tenzu.net>.
